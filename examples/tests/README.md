## Functional Tests

These trivial notebooks should be saved without any results.

The package `gonb/nbtests` executes (with `jupyter nbconvert --execute --to asciidoc ...`)
these notebooks and checks for the expected results.

Any changes here should be matched by corresponding tests in the package `gonb/nbtests`.
