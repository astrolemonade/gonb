# GoNB Changelog

## v0.3.0

* Added support for **Contextual Help** (`control+I` in Jupyter), by servicing message `inpect_request`.
* Fixed keys for function receivers: when redefining a receiver as a pointer (from by value)
  they wouldn't be overwritten, and the presence of both would conflict. Special case of #1.

## v0.2.0, v0.2.1

* Added support for pointer receivers when defining methods of a type.
* Added `%env` to set environment variables from the kernel.
